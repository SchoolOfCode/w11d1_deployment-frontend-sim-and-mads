# PLAN & PROGRESS

**Bonus: Research Netlify docs/ecosystem (for things like how to configure environment variables, etc.)**

**Bonus: Research Netlify edge functions, analytics, forms, identity, etc.**

Once you've finished researching for the bonus tasks, go ahead and implement all of the following Netlify features within your react app:

- Netlify Forms
  - **DONE.**
- Netlify Analytics
  - **NOTE.** Netlify Analytics are paid, so can't use these. You can integrate Google & other analytics into Netlify, but morally, Google analytics is a bit sketchy.
- Authentication/authorization to your app via Auth0 or Netlify Identity
- Netlify Edge functions
- Build out your SPA, and let your imagination run wild!
